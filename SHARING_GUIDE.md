## Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" error:**
- Make sure the bot is running
- Check firewall settings
- Verify the IP address is correct

**Others can't connect:**
- Are they on the same network? (for local sharing)
- Is Windows Firewall blocking it?
- Is the bot still running?

**ngrok URL doesn't work:**
- Make sure ngrok is running
- Check the ngrok window for the current URL
- Free tier URLs expire when ngrok closes
